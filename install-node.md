## Installing Node with NVM on Raspberry Pi

Many Node packages for Raspberry Pi hardware, such as [`nodeimu`](https://github.com/rupnikj/nodeimu) have not been updated to work with the most recent versions of Node, so being able to easily switch between versions with NVM is helpful.

Check the [NVM github](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for the most recent version.

```
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.2/install.sh | bash
```
