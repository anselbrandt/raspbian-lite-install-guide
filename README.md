## Raspbian Lite Install Guide

This is a step-by-step guide for installing Raspbian Lite onto a headless Raspberry Pi from a Mac. If everything works, your Raspberry Pi will:

  - connect to your WiFi network on boot
  - be visible in Finder as an SMB share
  - allow SSH login at username@raspberry-pi-name.local (I will use pi@pi1.local)

### 1. Download Raspbian Lite
